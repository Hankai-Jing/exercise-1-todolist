Todolist

This website is built as an exercise. I used Javascript and Rails to implement it.
To access the homepage, visit '/todilist'.

Most code is generated by Rails. The only file touched by me is app/views/todolist/index.html. Everything is contained in the file, including Javascript and CSS.

Gradually improvement will be applied to this website as I learn, which may involve putting code into the right place.
